/*
 * Forgetful — one live input, four tape memories, all of them forgetting.
 *
 * Build step 3 (docs/plans/forgetful-design.md, Build/Test Plan #3):
 * generalizes the single-LoopEngine build (step 2) to all four loops plus
 * the shared input router (Master page). Each loop's own record/degrade/
 * playback behavior is unchanged from step 2 — this step adds:
 *
 *   - a shared `input_routing` selector (A/B/C/D — no OFF/unrouted state,
 *     removed 2026-08-25 once recording became manual; see the ROUTE_A
 *     comment): only the currently routed loop can ever be RECORDING; the
 *     other three loops progress on their own (LOOPING keeps decaying,
 *     FORGOTTEN keeps flushing) regardless of routing.
 *   - routing-change-closes-recording: moving `input_routing` away from a
 *     loop that is currently RECORDING closes it immediately (in
 *     set_param, synchronously), via the same close_recording() path as
 *     master_record's second press and the buffer-full close.
 *
 * Recording is a MANUAL gesture (Master page's `master_record` trigger),
 * not level-detection — a level-based auto-trigger shipped first and was
 * replaced on-device feedback 2026-08-25: real playing levels didn't
 * reliably cross any single fixed threshold, and the trailing
 * silence-timeout baked an audible pause into the start of every loop.
 * First `master_record` press while routed and IDLE/FORGOTTEN starts
 * RECORDING; second press closes it (see close_recording, set_param).
 * Buffer-full (60s) remains as an automatic safety cap.
 *   - dry-once, wet-summed-across-four mixing: dry is read once and added
 *     once per sample (see mix_dry_wet), with all four loops' wet
 *     contributions — each scaled by that loop's own Master-page Volume
 *     knob — summed on top of it first.
 *
 * Mixing architecture (unchanged principle from step 2, docs/plans/
 * forgetful-design.md "Signal flow per block"): dry input passes through
 * UNCONDITIONALLY in every state, for every loop. This is an inline
 * audio_fx sitting between the synth and the output, so silence as *the*
 * output in any non-LOOPING state would mute the whole track.
 *
 * Timing model: unchanged — one shared, monotonically increasing
 * total_frames counter drives the forgotten-display window for all four
 * loops. No syscalls in the hot path.
 *
 * Page layout (5 pages x 8 knobs): declared as five named ui_hierarchy
 * levels — root (Master) plus loopA..loopD, each reached via a nav entry in
 * root's "params" — rather than one flat 40-key array. A flat array's
 * overflow auto-splits into "Main-2".."Main-5" continuation pages with no
 * separators on the bank bar; on-device feedback 2026-08-24. Separate levels
 * give each loop page its own name (just "A".."D", 2026-08-25 — was "Loop
 * A".."Loop D", trimmed in the same poetic-naming pass as ECHO/HOLD) and a
 * real section break, same mechanism moog/minijv use for "Filter"/
 * "Oscillator 1". The
 * root page itself is always titled "Main" by the page planner regardless of
 * any label declared here (fleet-wide convention). Unused knob slots (was
 * "reserved" dummy params, Master 7-8 and each loop's 7) are now bare ""
 * entries in knobs[] — true empty grid space, not a param.
 *
 *   Page 0 (Master, level "root"):  input_routing, master_loops_overview,
 *                      master_record, master_freeze, loopA_volume..loopD_volume
 *   Page 1-4 (levels "loopA".."loopD"): loopX_decay_rate (Age),
 *                      loopX_saturation (Drive), loopX_state (State),
 *                      loopX_erase, loopX_wow (Warp), loopX_hf_loss (Darken),
 *                      loopX_chaos (VINYL), loopX_hiss — order set 2026-08-25
 *                      on explicit on-device request (Age, Drive, State,
 *                      Erase, Warp, Darken, VINYL, Hiss; supersedes an
 *                      earlier same-day reorder). Wire keys are unaffected —
 *                      this is purely knobs[]/chain_params declaration order.
 *
 * settings-schema.json isn't wired yet; constants below hardcode the
 * design doc's stated defaults, same as step 2.
 *
 * Build step 4 (docs/plans/forgetful-design.md, Build/Test Plan #4): the
 * status-text half. `loopX_status` (previously a bare state-name stub) now
 * builds the full state line the design doc specifies — "Looping - NN%
 * (word)" while looping, via memory_word()'s bucket mapping, "Listening..."
 * / "Recording" / "Forgotten" otherwise. ASCII punctuation throughout
 * (hyphen, three periods), not an em-dash or the Unicode ellipsis, matching
 * the Erase trigger's idle-spelling call ("-", not "—").
 *
 * The Master page's "status overview" turned out not to be expressible as
 * text paired with each volume knob's cell: a chain_params entry only ever
 * annotates its OWN knob, never a neighbor's, and the knob-grid's value
 * cell (~30px at the 4x5 font — CELL_W/LABEL_CHARS in render_page_movy.mjs)
 * has room for roughly 6-8 characters, nowhere near a 23-character
 * "A:74% B:Rec C:-- D:12%" string. `master_loops_overview` ("Status" on the
 * Master page, access "read") is the fit-the-budget replacement: one glyph
 * per loop in A/B/C/D order, no separators — '-' idle/forgotten, 'R'
 * recording, else a memory decile digit (e.g. "7R-1"). Declared as an enum,
 * not a string — see the chain_params comment at its declaration below.

/* Flavor timing model v2, replaced 2026-08-25 (superseding the v1 "constant
 * shared rate" scheme from earlier the same day): Warp, Darken, Hiss and
 * VINYL are now TURN-BASED, not automatic. Each has a `flavor_ramp_t`
 * (target + step + touched) instead of a plain float:
 *
 *   - The FIRST set_param write to one of these keys since the take started
 *     (flavor_ramp_t.touched == 0) jumps `applied_X` straight to the new
 *     value with no ramp at all — "the first turn sets the current value".
 *   - Every write after that starts a fresh LINEAR ramp from wherever
 *     `applied_X` currently sits to the new target (flavor_ramp_set_param
 *     computes a fresh `.step`), timed to land exactly when THIS loop's
 *     memory would reach 0 — memory*decay_rate seconds from the moment of
 *     the turn, not decay_rate itself, so a turn made 90% of the way
 *     through a fade takes proportionally less time to arrive than one made
 *     right after recording. Nothing moves on its own between turns.
 *   - Every take starts completely untouched (reset_take/close_recording
 *     zero every flavor_ramp_t, same as applied_X) — a knob you dialed in on
 *     a previous take has no effect on the next one until you turn it again.
 *
 * Drive (saturation) is the ONE exception, deliberately: it keeps the v1
 * behavior — `applied_saturation` auto-chases toward the live `saturation`
 * knob value at the constant decay_rate-derived rate computed inline in the
 * LOOPING case, same as the day-one design. Only Warp/Darken/Hiss/VINYL got
 * the turn-based rework.
 *
 * HISS_CHASE_RATE_SCALE (the v1 per-flavor rate override that made hiss
 * chase 0.75x as fast as everyone else) is GONE — it was a workaround for
 * v1's single shared automatic rate. Under v2 the user directly controls
 * hiss's pacing by how they turn the knob, so a hardcoded slowdown no longer
 * has a place.
 *
 * Frozen is a THIRD mode layered on top (2026-08-25, "turning the flavour
 * knobs should change live the effect [while frozen]" — corrected same day:
 * "shouldn't snap instantly... let me control the value like I would
 * normally, ramp up or down the scale of the knob, no snapping"). Every
 * write to any of the five flavor knobs — including Drive — while
 * `loop->frozen` is set starts a SHORT, FIXED-DURATION glide (see
 * FROZEN_GLIDE_SECONDS) from wherever `applied_X` currently sits to the new
 * value, instead of either the v2 remaining-time ramp (meaningless here —
 * memory isn't draining) or an instant jump (reads as a snap/click, not a
 * knob being "played"). Retriggered on every write, same as the v2 ramp, so
 * turning the physical knob at a normal pace — a steady stream of small
 * writes — feels like continuous live tracking, not a stepped chase. It
 * still marks the ramp `touched`, so unfreezing "resumes normal mode...
 * with the new initial value... at the value set while frozen" — the next
 * turn after unfreezing ramps from wherever the frozen glide left it, not
 * from 0. See flavor_ramp_set_param's `frozen` argument and the
 * `saturation`/`saturation_glide_step` handling for Drive's parallel path
 * (it has no flavor_ramp_t, so it needs its own one-off step holder). */

 * mixed in ADDITIVELY alongside Hiss (see the LOOPING case), not as a mute.
 * Two densities layered: frequent, quiet "dust" clicks (the constant
 * surface texture) and rare, louder "pop" transients (occasional surface
 * damage) — a single density reads as either constant static or isolated
 * ticks at every setting, never a believable vinyl surface. Each trigger
 * adds an exponentially-decaying envelope value on top of whatever is

 *
 * Two-stage knob mapping, requested 2026-08-25 ("too intense" at the old

 * across the board on top of it): applied_crackle (0..1, via the v2 ramp
 * above) drives VOLUME linearly across its WHOLE range, but density
 * (trigger probability) sits at a fixed low baseline for the bottom half
 * and only climbs during the top half, reaching its ceiling — itself only
 * half of what the old single-stage mapping used at knob=1 — exactly at
 * applied_crackle=1. So the first half is "how loud are the (sparse,
