/*
 * Bench test for Forgetful's LoopEngine (docs/plans/forgetful-design.md,
 * Build/Test Plan #5): synthetic tone/silence input driven straight through
 * the module's public v2 API (create_instance/set_param/get_param/
 * process_block), exactly as chain_host would drive it. Black-box — this
 * does not reach into forgetful.c's internals, so the timing constants below
 * mirror forgetful.c's own documented defaults rather than its private
 * macros.
 *
 * Rewritten 2026-08-25 for the manual-record redesign (on-device feedback):
 * level-detection auto-trigger (record_threshold/debounce) and the
 * silence-timeout close are GONE, replaced by the Master page's
 * `master_record` trigger (press to start, press again to stop) — real
 * playing levels didn't reliably cross any single fixed threshold, and the
 * silence-timeout baked an audible pause into the start of every loop.
 * `loopX_decay_rate`'s UNIT also changed, from "repeats until forgotten" to
 * "seconds until forgotten" — decay is now continuous per-sample, not
 * stepped once per buffer wrap, so total disintegration time no longer
 * depends on how long the recording is.
 *
 * Covers:
 *   0. chain_params / ui_hierarchy shape — exactly 40 entries (8 master +
 *      4x8 loop), every expected key present in both, including
 *      master_record/master_freeze, and no OFF option in Route's options
 *      list.
 *   1. manual record start/stop — a fresh instance is already routed to A
 *      (no OFF/unrouted state); dry passthrough is unconditional across
 *      Idle/Recording/Looping; a press starts Recording immediately; a
 *      second press closes into Looping; a press while Looping is also a
 *      no-op (overdub/record-over is out of scope for v1); the
 *      master_record readout itself reflects REC while recording and "-"
 *      otherwise.
 *   2. decay timing (now wall-clock SECONDS, not repeats) + the
 *      forgotten_at display window.
 *   3. continuous decay — memory measurably drops well within a single wrap
 *      of a multi-second recording, proving decay no longer waits for a
 *      buffer wrap to progress.
 *   4. single-click erase on a LOOPING loop starts a fade-out (no confirm
 *      click any more — see forgetful.c's erase handler comment), and it
 *      completes and clears on schedule.
 *   5. a fresh master_record press claims a loop mid-erase-fade
 *      immediately rather than waiting out the fade.
 *   6. routing — closes A via a routing change (not buffer-full), and A's
 *      decay keeps progressing on its own after B becomes the active
 *      target.
 *   7. memory-word bucket mapping — every "NN% (word)" reading loopA_status
 *      produces while Looping matches the design doc's Vivid/Fading/Hazy/
 *      Almost gone boundaries, and all four are observed.
 *   8. master_loops_overview format — all-idle, one loop Recording, and a
 *      fresh-close memory decile alongside a second loop Recording, each
 *      checked byte-exact.
 *   9. too-short blip discard — close_recording's MIN_RECORDED_FRAMES floor,
 *      caught by a routing change (synchronous, instant) before the floor
 *      is cleared.
 *  10. parameter clamping/bounds on every knob (decay_rate's range is now
 *      3..300), plus a rejected (not clamped) out-of-range input_routing
 *      value.
 *  11. extreme decay_rate = 300 (the slow end, five minutes).
 *  12. erase in the two states 4/5 never exercise (both only fire while
 *      Looping) — Idle (no-op safety) and Recording (hard closes
 *      immediately, discarding the take).
 *  13. `state` get/set round-trip: live knobs survive into a fresh instance
 *      bit-for-bit; recorded content/playback position deliberately do not.
 *  14. saturation-stage passthrough: bit-exact identity at saturation=0
 *      (nonzero degrade) and at degrade=0 (any saturation).
 *  15. master_freeze — pauses decay in place while LOOPING (memory does
 *      not move at all while frozen, however long), resumes on a second
 *      press.
 *
 * Recordings are closed deliberately via the buffer-full path (feed a full
 * buffer_seconds of tone) rather than a manual second press, wherever a test
 * doesn't care about the close mechanism itself — buffer-full remains an
 * automatic close (a safety cap, per forgetful.c's set_param comment) and
 * gives an exact, known recorded_length with no manual-timing fuzziness.
 * Test 6 is the exception: it deliberately stops well short of buffer-full,
 * since proving the routing-change close fired requires that buffer-full
 * could not have.
